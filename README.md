# MNIST DATASET:

DATABASE => No adversarial noise CAPTCHA database

75_ADVERSARIAL_DATABASE => Database generated by applying 75 pixels of adversarial noise to LeNet

100_ADVERSARIAL_DOUBLE => Database created using 2 digits to fool LeNet and 2 to fool DP

100_HYBRID => Database created using 50 pixels to fool LeNet and 50 pixels to fool DP (fooling both models toghether)

100_FILTER_ADVERSARIAL_DATABASE_LENET => Database created by minimizing the prediction confidence with the filer

100_FILTER_HYBRID => Database created with the filter and 50 pixels to fool LeNet and 50 pixels to fool DP/

All the other generated databases have not been discussed on the paper, however one can guess how they were generated by their name

# Scripts:

AdaptedOnePixelAttack.py => Version of the one pixel attack adapted to grayscale images + filter addition

GeneratingAdversarialCaptchaDatabase.py => Script used to generate adversarial images 

GeneratingAdversarialCaptchaDatabaseBothModels.py => Script used to generate adversarial images with the combination of two models (50, 50 pixels)

GeneratingAdversarialCaptchaDatabaseBothModelsV2.py => Script used to generate adversarial images 

GeneratingMNISTCaptchas.py => Script used to generate normal Captchas with no adversarial noise

MultipleModelOnePixelAttack.py => Failled attempt to mix multiple models in the attack with the sum of the confidence probabilities

PertAtck.py => Differented crafted attack as a test, where small perturbations are added to the pixels in the differential evolution

Solving_MNIST_captchas.py => Main script to measure accuracy, solves the CAPTCHAS

Training_DP_No_Adversarial_MNIST.py => Trains DP with no Adversarial data
